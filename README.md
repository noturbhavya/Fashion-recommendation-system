<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This fashion recommendation system leverages a dataset of 44,000 images along with user preferences and style trends to provide personalized outfit and accessory suggestions. Using data-driven algorithms, it analyzes patterns in clothing styles to help users discover items that match their taste and keep up with current fashion trends.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-cleaning--preparation"></a>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>

- Removed duplicate or corrupted images from the dataset.
- Resized all images to a consistent dimension for uniform processing.
- Normalized pixel values to improve model training efficiency.
- Labeled images according to categories, styles, or attributes.
- Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Handled missing or inconsistent metadata (e.g., style tags, color info).
- Applied data augmentation (rotation, flipping, cropping) to increase dataset diversity

<h2><a class="anchor" id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

- Visualized the distribution of clothing categories and styles.
- Analyzed color trends and patterns across the dataset.
- Examined the frequency of different clothing attributes (e.g., sleeve type, patterns, fabric).
- Checked class balance to identify underrepresented categories.
- Explored correlations between style attributes and user preferences.
- Sampled images to validate labeling and dataset quality.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="final-recommendations"></a>Final Recommendations</h2>

- Expand the dataset with more diverse images to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Incorporate user feedback to refine and personalize suggestions over time.
- Experiment with advanced deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, Vision Transformers) for better feature extraction.
- Integrate seasonal and trending fashion data for timely recommendations.
- Enhance the system with multi-modal inputs (e.g., text descriptions, user reviews) for richer suggestions.
- Implement real-time recommendation updates based on user interactions.
